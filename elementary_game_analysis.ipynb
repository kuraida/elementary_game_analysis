    "### In this notebook I aim to grasp a better understanding of visual analysis in python by cutting my teeth on video game data scraped from the web. First I will scrape data from an online video games database. I will then munge and parse the data for use, and finally visualize several aspects of the data using python code in order to extract a variety of conclusions. While the end conclusions I reach from the data are not the overall goal of this project, I hope to come away with at least a few worthwhile ideas about games I may want to put on my \"to-play\" list."
